# SSSeva-publications-and-articles

This multi-folder repository keeps the materials and source-files (some in Jupyter Notebook) used for preparing my publications in the internet on the DA/DS/ML topics.

Purpose of this repository: to enrich my portfolio for my job hunting CVs - available in parallel GitHub project here.

| 01 | regression_ slope_ degraded_by_ datanoise_ inRUS | Apparently, this effect has historically led to the use of the term "regression".  We will talk about a small instructive fact in the field of linear regression, which will be shown experimentally and explained by analytical formulas using the example of simple linear regression.  This fact is probably known to those who have thoroughly studied the topic of linear regression in a regular way, but self-taught and graduates of Internet courses, whose name is legion today due to the popularity of the topic, could well have slipped past it.  Knowledge of this fact will be practically useful for correcting intuitive ideas about linear regression. | <a href='https://habr.com/p/719382/'>Habr</a> | published |
| 02 | hospital_ beds_sufficiency_ in_ russian_cities_ inRUS | A simple ML exercise on the real statistics data about Russian cities: using the index of population growth we derive the logistic regression in the coordinates of medical parameters, that says which level of hospital beds provisioning is to be considered as sufficient to cope with the local health problems in a city. | Habr | awaiting moderation |
